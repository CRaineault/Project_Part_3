My own goals for this next lab:

I want to find a way to create separate file based on the
different floors/based on the different puzzles. This will
make it easier to create the code and organize it

I also want to create comments to describe what each
picture/room actually represents

I also want to make it easier for me to create the rooms/
require less code. Right now it is really messy... I am
basically building each one from scratch, when I really want
to make my own custom component to use instead.

I want to keep the main app with the elevator code, have
the third floor as its own file, and have each puzzle as
its own file (or group the puzzles on the same floor
together)

I also would like to experiment with making the buttons
and arrows fit more consistently on people's screens... I
am unsure if this will be a big issue or small issue, I will
explore that first...

I want to also take some pictures for more classrooms/
hallways to make exploration more fun and leave more room
for puzzles.
